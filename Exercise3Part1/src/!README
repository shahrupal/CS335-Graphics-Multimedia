Description of Exercise 3, Part 1:
The two files (WindowContents & RotatingRectangle) work together to create an ouput for the user.
WindowContents creates the window itself - it adds the rectangle and buttons to this.
The buttons included in WindowContents, stop and reset, stop the rectangle in its current position and resets the rectangle to its
original position, respectively.
RotatingRectangle waits for the user to click inside of the rectangle. When this occurs, the rectangle rotates around that point,
incrementing by 1 degree, every 50 milliseconds. It does this by using the repaint() method to re-draw the rectangle increasingly
more degrees away from its original position.
