step to running the program
1. must load 2 images from menu bar
  - i have included a sample image in my folder entitled a.jpg
2. user may move points on either panel
3. when finished, select "morph button"
4. program will allow user to exit out of pop-up window and will allow user to continue moving the same points,
however this will not give accurate results. instead, user must exit out of main window as well and start from beginning, 
rather than try to change the control points before the morph.
